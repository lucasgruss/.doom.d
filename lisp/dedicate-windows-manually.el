;;; Commentary:

;; Introduction
;; ============

;; The functions here defined allow you to manually dedicate and
;; undedicate windows, that is, prevent `set-window-buffer' from
;; considering them when selecting a window in which to display a
;; given buffer.

;; Windows dedicated in this fashion will also be protected from
;; splitting by setting `window-size-fixed'.

;; Installation
;; ============

;; Place this file in your load path; then, place the following
;; command somewhere in your initialization file:

;; (require 'dedicate-windows-manually)

;; Now you can use M-x dedicate-window to dedicate the selected window
;; to its currently displayed buffer, M-x undedicate-window to release
;; a dedication so applied, and M-x dedicate-window-toggle to switch
;; between the states.

;; These functions will operate only on manually dedicated or
;; undedicated windows; that is, M-x dedicate-window will not dedicate
;; a window which is already dedicated (i.e. "(window-dedicated-p
;; window) -> t", and M-x undedicate-window will not undedicate a
;; window which was not dedicated by way of M-x dedicate-window.

;; If you find yourself frequently doing M-x dedicate-window-toggle,
;; you might wish to place something like this in your init file:

;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 4 C-d") 'dedicate-window-toggle)

;; Bugs:
;; * Changing the lighter string while you have windows dedicated is
;;   probably not a good idea.
;; * I should certainly find a better way to change the mode line.

;;; Code:

(defcustom dedicated-window-lighter-string " [D]"
  "A string, propertized with `dedicated-window-lighter-face', prepended
to the mode line of manually dedicated windows.")

(defvar dedicated-windows-by-hand nil
  "A list of windows known to have been manually dedicated. Windows not
in this list will not be undedicated by `undedicate-window'.")

(defun dedicate-window-was-by-hand-p (window)
  (let ((result nil))
    (cl-loop for w in dedicated-windows-by-hand
          collect (if (eq w window) (setq result t)))
    result))

(defun dedicate-window (&optional window flag)
  "Dedicate a window to its buffer, and prevent it from being split.

Optional argument WINDOW, if non-nil, should specify a window. Otherwise,

  (interactive nil)
  (if (eq nil window) (setq window (selected-window)))
  (if (eq nil flag) (setq flag t))
  (if (window-dedicated-p window)
      (message "Window is already dedicated.")
    (progn
      (add-to-list 'dedicated-windows-by-hand window)
      (setq mode-line-format
            (append `(,dedicated-window-lighter-string) mode-line-format))
      (setq window-size-fixed nil)
      (set-window-dedicated-p window flag))))

  "Un-dedicate a window from its buffer.

        (setq window-size-fixed nil)
        (set-window-dedicated-p window nil)))))

(defun dedicate-window-toggle (&optional window)
  "Toggle a window's manual buffer dedication state.
